# tictactoe

Web based TicTacToe game coded mostly in C++ for backend and others for forming the front end in an OOP manner. Game created without pre-supplied code, was created only through looking up the rules of the game and necessary features it must have. "AI" is just a series of logic statements that the program runs through to find the most optimal solution. Does not have any learning or performance tracking.

To run game compile files by typing make into console when in the appropriate folder, then ./bin/server -t templates -s static. The application will be hosted on the local ip 127.0.0.1:18080 where you can view the game and play it.
